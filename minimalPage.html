NO ONE FUCKING NEEDS FANCY FUCKING GRAPHICS FOR THEIR SHITTY BLOG WITH SO MUCH FUCKING ADS AND LIKE FUCKING TRACKERS SELLING ALL YOUR DATA TO FUCKING BILL GATES. These FUCKING soydevs with their FUCKING macbooks adn their shitty gui text editor making their FUCKING website with the shittiest FUCKING websites. So become redpilled and make a minimal website</p>
